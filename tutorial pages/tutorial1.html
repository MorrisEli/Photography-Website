        Exposure Triangle. The Exposure Triangle comprises aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. These three camera and lens controls work together to regulate the amount of light that makes it to the light-sensitive surface (aperture and shutter speed) and the sensitivity of that surface (film or digital ISO).

The exposure triangle is made up of three components: shutter speed, aperture and ISO. A simple analogy for this would be to think in terms of collecting water in a bucket. The bucket represents the camera sensor while the water represents light.
