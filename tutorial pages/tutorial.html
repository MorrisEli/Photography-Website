        The Rule of Thirds is a common compositional technique that divides your frame into an equal, three-by-three grid with two horizontal lines and two vertical lines that intersect at four points. The Rule of Thirds places your subject on the left-third or right-third of the frame, creating a pleasing composition.

    <h3>Centering Photos</h3>

    <p>
        Essentially, the rule of thirds tells you not to place the main elements in the 
        center of photos. For example, if you're photographing a waterfall, you wouldn't put 
        it directly in the center. Instead, you'd shift it to the left or right.
